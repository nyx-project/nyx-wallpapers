# nyx-wallpapers

These are wallpapers whose creation process involves programs.

The process is as follows:

+ I try to write a program that generates some kind of pattern for certain size and saves it as SVG;
+ I manually edit the logo (which is in the `elements` folder) into the SVG file and export a PNG file using Inkscape.

The programs are written very crudely and some of them only works part of the times (!); this is okay because for each pattern I only need one good output to work with.
